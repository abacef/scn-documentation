We believe that diversity in our community is critical and should be celebrated. We welcome everyone of any race, age, gender, nationality, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, religion, education, and skill level. The SCN community and experience often extends outside those spaces. Members meet in person to collaborate on projects, attend related meetups or conferences together, and communicate on social media. Abusive or unwelcoming behavior between SCN Members still has a profound impact on individuals and on the community when it happens beyond our events and online forums. We will use our discretion when deciding whether to enforce this code of conduct after reports of such behavior happening outside of our spaces, taking into account the impact on the individual Members involved as well as the impact on the community at large. Types of Behavior Encouraged Behavior All participants are expected to: be considerate, respectful, and collaborative. Specifically we expect participants to: Demonstrate empathy, kindness, and patience toward other people Assume the best intentions from others Be respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback Accept responsibility and apologize to those affected by our mistakes, and learn from the experience Focus on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community Unacceptable Behavior The following types of behavior are unacceptable at SCN, both online and in-person, and constitute code of conduct violations. Abusive Behavior Harassment Offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, immigration status, language, religion, or education level Sexual images in public spaces, unwelcome sexual or romantic attention, and inappropriate physical contact. Threats Threating someone physically or verbally. For example, threatening to publicize sensitive information about someone's personal life Hacking Any kind of malicious or harmful behavior towards other network users and their devices/data/property, or towards the network and its equipment or normal functioning. For example, DDOS attacks or unauthorized remote access. Unwelcoming Behavior Blatant -isms Saying things that are explicitly racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. For example, arguing that some people are less intelligent because of their gender, race or religion. Subtle -isms and small mistakes made in conversation are not code of conduct violations. However, repeating something after it has been pointed out to you that you made a member feel unwelcome, broke a social rule or antagonizing or arguing with someone who has pointed out your subtle -ism is considered unwelcoming behavior and is not allowed in SCN. Maliciousness towards other members Deliberately attempting to make others feel bad, name-calling, singling out others for derision or exclusion. For example, telling somone they're not technical enough or that they don't belong in SCN. Being especially unpleasant For example, if we've received reports from multiple members of annoying, rude, or especially distracting behavior. For example, repeatedly engaging in bad faith arguments, talking down to people, or excluding people from participation. Reporting Please report code of conduct violations either to the event organizer, by emailing lcl@seattlecommunitynetwork.org or by alerting moderators on Discord with the @moderators group tag. All of our moderators are volunteers, and will response with their best effort. However, if you provide your name, or contact info we promise to respond within two business days. How to Report In your report, please include: Subject line \"[SCN Code of Conduct Violation Report]\" followed by descriptive subject Your name This is incredibly helpful for us to be able to follow up with you, and ask questions to better understand the situation. You are welcome to report anonymously. Please only use this option if you really need to, and know that we might not be able to take action without knowing who you are. In any case, provide an email address so we can correspond with you about the report. A detailed description of what happened If the violation happened online, please link to or send us the relevant text. If the violation happened in person, please detail exactly what the other person said or did. In order to take action, we need to know the concrete actions that someone took. Where and when the incident happened Any other relevant context. Do you have examples of a pattern of similar behavior? Do you have a relationship with this person outside of SCN? If/how you've already responded - this lets us know the current state of the situation. Why to Report You are responsible for making SCN a safe and comfortable space for everyone. Everyone in our community shares this responsibility. Our volunteer Moderators are not around all the time, so we cannot enforce the code of conduct without your help. The consequences for SCN of not reporting bad behavior outweigh the consequences for one person reporting it. We sometimes hear \u201cI don\u2019t want X person to meet consequences because I told someone about their bad behavior.\u201d Consider the impact on everyone else at SCN of letting their behavior continue unchecked. SCN only works as a self-directed, community-driven effort because of shared trust between members. Reporting code of conduct violations helps us identify when this trust is broken, to prevent that from happening in the future. Enforcement Guidelines Moderators will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct. Correction Community Impact: Unwelcoming behavior. Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. Consequence: A private, written warning from moderators, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public or private apology may be requested in the venue where the behavior took place, for example on Discord or at the event. Warning Community Impact: A violation through a single incident of abusive behavior or series of unwelcoming behaviors. Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. Temporary Ban Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained unwelcoming behavior. Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of participation, interaction, or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban. Permanent Ban Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained unwelcoming behavior, harassment or threatening of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals. Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of participation, or public interaction within the community. Discussion If you have questions about any aspect of the code of conduct, or want to propose amending it, please contact the @moderators group, or drop in to the public #governance channel on Discord.

Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment) is an open-source server management platform designed to deploy and manage virtual machines (VMs) and containers. It integrates KVM hypervisor and LXC containers, enabling users to manage virtual infrastructure through a web-based interface. Section 2: Access Requirements for Proxmox VE at Seattle Community Network To submit a request for a SCN self-hosted Proxmox VM on our private cloud, please fill out this form . If you are working on a project for SCN and need access to the Proxmox VE, please continue reading. Next, you will need access to the OpenVPN. Proxmox VE can only be accessed on the VPN. Specific details can be obtained from the SCN discord. Once connected to the VPN, a specific IP will be provided for you to access the Proxmox VE, where you can input your credentials. Section 3: Setting up your VM Install SSH Install Keys Test SSH CLI Section 4: SSH Troubleshooting Please let the SCN discord know if you have trouble SSH'ing in. A useful command during setup was sudo ufw status . If it is active, use ufw disable . The expected status should be inactive. If that still doesn\u2019t work, try restarting the VM from the Proxmox VE. Section 5: Beginning Deployment: Vaultwarden docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest docker run -d --name vaultwarden -v /vw-data/:/data/ --restart unless-stopped -p 80:80 vaultwarden/server:latest Section 6: Docker Compose Create a Docker Compose file: version: \"3\" services: vaultwarden: container_name: vaultwarden hostname: vaultwarden9 ports: - \"127.0.0.1:8080:80\" environment: - LOG_FILE=/log/access.log - LOG_LEVEL=info - EXTENDED_LOGGING=true image: vaultwarden/server:latest restart: unless-stopped volumes: - /opt/vw-data:/data - /var/log/vw:/log To start and run your container application in detached mode, use: docker-compose up -d docker-compose start docker-compose stop docker-compose restart Section 7: Azure DNS For this deployment, we're utilizing a public IP address. This address must be configured within Azure DNS to point to our chosen domain name. Navigate to Home - Microsoft Azure with your account. Open \u201cDNS zones\u201d. If you were using a private IP, you would use \u201cPrivate DNS zones\u201d. We will be creating a subdomain under seattlecommunitynetwork.org. Click on that, and under DNS management, click recordsets, and click add. Insert the beginning of the subdomain name, which in our case is \u201cvaultwarden\u201d. Below, under IP address, insert your IP, and create your new subdomain. Section 8: Enabling Nginx sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl enable nginx sudo systemctl start nginx Next, go to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default . Delete everything inside default and paste this: # The `upstream` directives ensure that you have a http/1.1 connection # This enables the keepalive option and better performance # # Define the server IP and ports here. upstream vaultwarden-default { zone vaultwarden-default 64k; server 127.0.0.1:8080; keepalive 2; } # Needed to support websocket connections # See: https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/websocket.html # Instead of \"close\" as stated in the above link we send an empty value. # Else all keepalive connections will not work. map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade { default upgrade; '' \"\"; } # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name vaultwarden.seattlecommunitynetwork.org; if ($host = vaultwarden.seattlecommunitynetwork.org) { return 301 https://$host$request_uri; } return 404; } server { # For older versions of nginx appened http2 to the listen line after ssl and remove `http2 on` listen 443 ssl; listen [::]:443 ssl; # http2 on; server_name vaultwarden.seattlecommunitynetwork.org; # Specify SSL Config when needed ssl_certificate /etc/path...; ssl_certificate_key /etc/path...; ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/path...; client_max_body_size 525M; location / { proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_pass http://vaultwarden-default; } # Optionally add extra authentication besides the ADMIN_TOKEN # Remove the comments below `#` and create the htpasswd_file to have it active # #location /admin { # See: https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-http-basic-authentication/ #auth_basic \"Administrator's Area\"; #3auth_basic_user_file /path/to/htpasswd_file; #proxy_http_version 1.1; #proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; #proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade; #proxy_set_header Host $host; #proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; #proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; #proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; #proxy_pass http://vaultwarden-default; } } Section 9: Obtain SSL Certificates sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx sudo certbot --nginx -d vaultwarden.seattlecommunitynetwork.org Certbot will modify your Nginx configuration to handle HTTPS and redirect from HTTP to HTTPS. Ensure that you copy the file paths provided at the conclusion of the certbot process into the default nginx configuration file, replacing the corresponding comments with these paths. Section 10: Ensure Everything is Running sudo systemctl status nginx Section 11: Additional Features Enabling admin panel: Go back to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default and uncomment the admin section at the bottom. Follow directions at Nginx Admin Guide to encrypt your admin password as a .env file (preferably using argon CLI). Once done, make sure you create a .env file in the directory where the compose file is with VAULTWARDEN_ADMIN_TOKEN=[insert your hashed admin token] . Then in your compose, add these two lines under environment: - ADMIN_TOKEN=${VAULTWARDEN_ADMIN_TOKEN} - DOMAIN=https://vaultwarden.seattlecommunitynetwork.org Restart the container and try logging into https://vaultwarden.seattlecommunitynetwork.org/admin . Once logged in, SMTP and 2FA enabling settings can be configured on the home page. Section 12: Data Backup Enabling backups for Vaultwarden is a simple process. Please review the attached backup bash script, which facilitates the transfer of Vaultwarden data to another virtual machine. Additionally, there is a cleanup bash script designed to retain only the most recent file in the other VM, deleting all others. Feel free to modify the scripts as necessary to suit your specific requirements. Backup script: #!/bin/bash docker-compose down datestamp=$(date +%m-%d-%Y) zip -9 -r /home/scn/backups/${datestamp}.zip /opt/vw-data* scp -i ~/.ssh-comm/id_rsa /home/scn/backups/${datestamp}.zip azureuser@[IP address]:~/backups/ docker-compose up -d Cleanup Script: #!/bin/bash # Define the directory containing backup files backup_dir=~/backups # Go to the backup directory cd \"$backup_dir\" || exit # Find and delete older backup files (excluding the latest day) find . -type f -name '*.zip' ! -mtime -1 -exec rm {} + # Exit exit 0 Section 13: Using the Backup To restore a data backup to the original virtual machine, simply unzip the file and delete the existing contents of /opt/vw-data . Then, transfer the contents of your zip file into this directory. Perform a quick restart of the container, and you will have successfully restored the version of the backup you selected.","title":"Proxmox Deployment Guide - Vaultwarden"},{"location":"infrastructure/proxmox-vaultwarden-deployment/#deployed-by-esther-jang-paul-phillion-rudra-singh","text":"","title":"Deployed by: Esther Jang, Paul Phillion, Rudra Singh"},{"location":"infrastructure/proxmox-vaultwarden-deployment/#section-1-what-is-proxmox","text":"Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment) is an open-source server management platform designed to deploy and manage virtual machines (VMs) and containers.

To clarify this process, here\u2019s a step by step walkthrough tutorial of the setup of a Baicells eNodeB (eNB) base station running in the Citizen\u2019s Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum band (or band 48). Before following this tutorial, you should have completed the setup of a LTE Evolved Packet Core (EPC) to control your eNB, for which the setup of an open source version based on open5gs is outlined in this tutorial . I. Get set up with a Spectrum Access System (SAS) A. Why get set up with a SAS? Current FCC regulations require all CBRS equipment (called a CBSD) to be registered on a Spectrum Access System (SAS) that coordinates all spectrum assignments and ensures that no transmissions interfere with each other. This will likely require a commercial agreement with a SAS provider such as Google, Federated Wireless, etc. This tutorial uses the Google SAS. B. CPI License At least one member of your team will require \u201cCertified Professional Installer\u201d (CPI) training and license in order to hold legal responsibility for and sign off on device installations. Most SAS providers will offer training at about $500 for both an online training course and the certification exam. If you aren\u2019t able to get someone on your team certified, be sure to collaborate with a CPI! Feel free to contact us at the Local Connectivity Lab if you need support for your community project in this regard, and we can figure out what is feasible. The following are some links and helpful notes about this process: * https://wifidevan.wordpress.com/cbrs-certified-professional-installer-cpi-study-notes/ * https://alliancecorporation.ca/webinars/webinars-webinars/cbrs-for-beginners-part-2-by-commscope/ * https://cbrs.wirelessinnovation.org/acronyms C. SAS Pricing Agreements For Google, the price options provided us in summer 2020 were: Fixed Wireless SAS services are billed per link/household so you pay for each CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) CBSD registered with SAS. CBSDs that operate as base stations are free of charge. Price Per Customer Link $2.25/month. Mobility/Private LTE (price is based on CBSD categoris) Category A CBSD max transmit capability: 30 dBm/10 MHz = 20 dBm/MHz or \u201c1 Watt\u201d mounted under 6m Height Above Average Terrain measured 3-16 km away from site $2.67/month Category B CBSD max transmit capability: Maximum EIRP of 47 dBm/10 MHz = 37 dBm/MHz or \u201c50 Watt\" $13.33/month. D. SAS Registration CBSDs must register their transmit capabilities with the SAS using either the \u201cone-step\u201d or \u201cmulti-step\u201d process. The one-step process requires you to input all installation parameters and sign them with the CPI certificate all on the base station itself, or via a cloud domain proxy such as used by Baicells. Not all base stations support this and the interfaces for doing so might vary widely, so \u201cmulti-step\u201d is typically recommended. II. Register device in SAS portal This tutorial will be walking through steps following the specifics of the Google SAS portal interface, but the steps should be generalizable to other SAS portals. A. Once you have an account on an SAS service, register your devices on their portal or dashboard. The Google SAS portal can be found at: https://wirelessconnectivity.google.com/sas/ B. Our Setup Our test setup in the lab includes: 1W Baicells Nova 233 base station in the CBRS band mounted on the 6th floor balcony of our UW computer science building. Alpha Wireless 18 dBi-gain panel antenna with a beamwidth of 65 degrees (model AW3014-T4), mounted straight ahead and not tilted down. C. Example Configuration An example configuration for this setup is shown below. The configuration screen is a right-hand sidebar next to the map view, hence the unwieldy aspect ratio. Explanation of parameters: CBSD Category (A or B): Defined by rules in Section I.C above User ID Specified by the SAS provider when you register FCC ID and Serial Number: Both the radio and antenna model must be pre-authorized for use with CBRS by the FCC. The FCC ID is used to identify this approved device type. The serial number specifies the exact device identity. Both can usually be found on the outside of the device (circled in image below). Beamforming Gain, Beamwidth Based on antenna specs in II.B EIRP Effective Isotropic Radiated Power of your system including both the base station radio and antenna. For a Cat B CBSD, this must be 46 dBm/10 MHz=36 dBm/MHz or lower. Calculate this value by adding the max transmit power (actually power density per MHz) of the base station, in our case 28 dBm, to the antenna beamforming gain, in our case 18 dBi; 28+18=36 dBm/MHz. For the units requested by the Google interface, add 10 to this value to specify power per 10 MHz instead of per MHz. Height Specified in terms of height Above Ground Level (AGL) which you can measure using a rangefinder/ measuring tape/ building plan, or in height Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL). Not in terms of HAAT as in the Cat A/B definition. Must be accurate to within 3 m. Azimuth Refers to the compass heading/ direction that the antenna is pointing (set this to 0 for an omnidirectional antenna). This FCC tool is extremely helpful for calculating the azimuth based on the antenna\u2019s gps location and that of a structure you are pointing it at. You can get these GPS coordinates via Google Maps or Google Earth. Air Interface E_UTRA is the LTE radio standard used by our Baicells box. The only \u201csupported spec\u201d currently available for Baicells is FFS (according to a forum post, linked here). Location: In the Google interface, set the site location in GPS coordinates under the tab labeled with the map pin icon. (not shown) Parameters under \"CBSD Info\" Call Sign As far as I can tell, this can be any reasonable alphanumeric string as long as it is unique and matches the value of the \u201ccall sign\u201d parameter as sent over by the eNB or domain proxy. You will set this in the SAS interface as well as either the eNB or Baicells Cloud Core (they all need to match). Others These should match the settings with the same name on the eNB\u2019s local management portal, shown on the \u201cBasic Info\u201d page in section IV.A below. D. CPI Signature When the parameters are all filled out, click the big red \u201cReady for CPI\u201d button at the bottom of the panel (not shown here). On the CPI\u2019s version of the interface, it will provide a place to \u201csign\u201d the configuration with their CPI certificate, which they will upload to the interface. This must happen before the device can get a spectrum grant. E. Status Tab After the CPI signs the eNB configuration, under the \u201cStatus\u201d tab (visible in the config panel), you should see \u201cNot yet Registered\u201d (or a similar message) because the eNB has not checked in to the Google SAS yet with its matching parameters to complete the multi-step process. If something has otherwise gone wrong, you\u2019ll see an error message here. F. Other helpful links Google CBSD registration and deregistration Elevation finder tool with map III. Steps in Baicells Cloud interface A. Make a Baicells OMC account. Due to Baicells\u2019 use of a \u201cdomain proxy\u201d for their SAS requests, you will need to make a new user account in the Baicells Operators Management Console (OMC): https://cloudcore.baicells.com:4443/ This is distinct from their paid \u201cCloud Core\u201d service which we will not be using in this tutorial, although the management portal is the same. B. Take note of the CloudKey Once you have made an account, note the 6-letter \u201cCloudKey\u201d in the upper right corner of the screen (circled in red). This will need to be inputted into the local eNB management portal for the eNB to check into the Cloud OMC. On your version of this portal, if you\u2019re doing this for the first time, you shouldn\u2019t see any eNBs already present. C. Set your SAS service provider. Navigate to Advance\u2192SAS in the left hand menu, and then click the gear icon on the upper right corner, which has the hover text \u201cSettings.\u201d IV. Steps in Baicells management interface A. Local Management Portal The Baicells eNodeB (eNB) is best managed through the browser-based management portal; the current command line interface is accessible but extremely limited. The default IP address of the management portal (and that of most Baicells equipment I\u2019ve seen) is 192.168.150.1, and the default login credentials are admin/admin. I would recommend changing the admin login credentials to be more secure. Connect your computer to the eNB via Ethernet, and navigate to this IP address in your browser (using http://192.168.150.1, not https). Baicells Initial Login Screen: BTS Info\u2192\u201cBasic Info\u201d Page visible upon login: B. Upgrade firmware Upgrade the firmware to the latest firmware version that supports SAS functionality, or verify that it is already up to date. You can check the official firmware page under the correct eNB model. The Nova 233 CBRS small cell we\u2019re using is model mBS1105. The latest firmware version after which SAS is officially supported is BaiBS_RTS_3.6.6.IMG (as of Feb 2021), for which the direct download is available here . Do not skip this step, otherwise none of the following steps will work right. C. Get everything connected Once the firmware is upgraded, you will want to get the eNB connected to your local LTE core network (EPC) as well as to the Internet so it can contact the necessary SAS infrastructure. 1. Configure Internet Access (WAN) Navigate to the Network\u2192WAN/LAN/VLAN tab on the left hand menu. We will set the WAN interface IP address to 192.168.151.1, since the Baicells console requires (for whatever reason) a different subnet for the WAN as opposed to the LAN. Then we will connect the eNB to an Ethernet port on the EPC that has the IP address 192.168.151.2 (as set up in our previous tutorial), which will act as the eNB\u2019s Internet gateway. Don\u2019t forget to hit \u201cSave\u201d after each change you make in this interface. 2. Check Internet access At this point, if the EPC is configured correctly to pass eNB traffic to the Internet, the eNB should be able to ping an arbitrary IP address. To test this, navigate to the Network\u2192Diagnostics tab on the left hand menu and select \u201cPing\u201d under the \u201cMethod of Diagnostics\u201d dropdown menu. Set the \u201cTarget IP Domain\u201d to be a highly reachable IP address on the Internet such as 1.1.1.1, which is the CloudFlare DNS server. Press \u201cImplement.\u201d If the result is \u201cFail!\u201d as in the screenshot, there is likely something wrong with your eNB\u2019s Internet connection through the EPC; you should fix this issue before continuing. 3. Reboot as needed If a message appears that the eNB needs a reboot after the new settings are saved, navigate to the Reboot tab in the left hand menu and perform the reboot (Warm Reset is fine). 4. Attach to Baicells OMC To configure the eNB to talk to the OMC as discussed in the prior section, navigate to the BTS Setting\u2192Management Server tab in the management console and enter the CloudKey. Within a few minutes, the eNB should appear in your Baicells Cloud OMC console, and the \u201cBasic Info\u201d page should show that the OMC is \u201cConnected.\u201d 5. Disable IPsec For our purposes we will not be using IPsec between our EPC and eNB; the default IPSec configured is used for the Baicells Cloud EPC which we are not using. Navigate to the Network\u2192\u201cMME&IPSec Binding\u201d menu tab and set \u201cIPSec Status\u201d to \u201cDisable.\u201d You may also delete the IPSec tunnels as shown below. 6. Disable GPS Sync when testing indoors. Navigate to the \u201cBTS Setting\u201d\u2192\u201cSync Setting\u201d menu and disable both \u201cForced Sync\u201d and \u201cGPS Sync Switch,\u201d in case you need to work with the base station in a location where you don\u2019t have a strong GPS signal. Some base stations will not start up normally or attach to the EPC unless they get a GPS signal, and we should avoid this behavior. 7. Change the MME settings Change the MME settings. Since we are using our local EPC, we will need to change the MME settings to reflect our MME\u2019s IP address, on which it is listening for eNBs to attach, as well as other configurations. Navigate to the BTS Info\u2192Quick Setting tab on the left hand menu. Disable RF You should set the \u201cRF Status\u201d setting to \u201cDisable\u201d before you change the MME IP, because attaching to the MME will normally cause the eNB\u2019s radio to turn on. Since we have not enabled the eNB to ask for spectrum coordinated by the SAS yet, turning on the radio may cause unwanted interference on someone else\u2019s network. PLMN setting Remove the existing \u201cPLMN ID\u201d (by clicking the trash can symbol) and set it to the value that you have configured in your EPC. In our networks, we use \u201c91054\u201d as our PLMN, so add this as a \u201cPrimary\u201d and \u201cNotReserved\u201d PLMN by entering the number in the text box and clicking the \u201c+\u201d button. MME IP address Remove the existing MME IP associated with the old PLMN. Add the new MME IP address, in our case 192.168.150.2, by entering it in the text box and clicking \u201c+\u201d. This MME IP should be associated with the newly added PLMN by default. Save the changes and reboot the eNB (Warm Reset); after the reboot has finished (within a few minutes), the eNB should attach to the MME. If you navigate to BTS Info\u2192Basic Info, you should see the MME Status change from \u201cNot Connected\u201d to \u201cConnected.\u201d If you are looking at the MME logs on the EPC, you will also see the record that an eNB has attached. 8. Enable SAS SAS should only be enabled after successfully attaching the eNB to the MME. Unfortunately, when SAS is enabled, the eNB will not attach to the MME unless it has a currently valid authorization to transmit on a certain frequency. However, until it is attached to an MME, the Baicells Cloud OMC will not provide it this authorization. So we need to have SAS disabled first with the RF also disabled, attach the eNB to the MME, and then enable SAS. Choose \u201cMulti-step\u201d under \u201cSAS Registration Type,\u201d as specified in Section I.E. Also choose \u201cB\u201d under \u201ccategory,\u201d and write in the other parameters to match the ones with the same name in the Google SAS configuration. After you click \u201cSave,\u201d SAS should be enabled immediately. You should see the SAS enabled status change in the Baicells Cloud OMC. If all goes smoothly, your device should get an authorization to transmit within a few minutes and the radio should turn on! 9. Check Baicells CLOUD OMC to debug issues You can check the status of the SAS authorization process in the Cloud OMC. Here you can find logs (upper right corner of SAS screen, shown in the screenshot below) with any error messages that may have occurred in the process. Errors can be caused by invalid or non-matching parameter values, lack of CPI signature, lack of spectrum availability, etc. In more difficult cases, after device registration the SAS may not respond to spectrum inquiries without sending any clear error messages. I have encountered this scenario when requesting spectrum around midnight, which may have been caused by brief database unavailability during the daily \u201cSAS Sync\u201d or IAP. My recommendation is to avoid requesting a new spectrum grant after 11 pm PST. If you change anything about the equipment used on site or the location/orientation of the equipment, you need to change the SAS registration, have it re-signed by the CPI, and use the Baicells OMC to re-request a new spectrum authorization- this process is described in the following section. V. How to change location, antenna properties, etc. after deployment As an example, this section will show how you would change the equipment\u2019s location upon moving from test site to deployment site. Get the new GPS location either manually using Google Maps/Earth, or automatically using Baicells OMC\u2019s GPS reading for the eNB if available. Google SAS steps In the upper right hand corner of the Google SAS configuration for the deployed equipment (long narrow right side panel for a particular site), press the unlock button (shaped like a padlock) to make the configuration editable. To edit the site location, click on the map pin icon in the upper left corner of this same right hand configuration panel to enter the location panel. Enter the new GPS coordinates in the box. After your changes, lock the site configuration again. (If the red \u201cReady for CPI\u201d button appears again at the bottom of the main configuration panel, go ahead and click it to prompt the CPI to sign.) You may have to wait a few minutes or hours for the changes to sync to the CPI\u2019s SAS database view. If after a while the CPI still cannot see the location change, ask them to enter the new GPS coordinates in their own interface and re-sign the configuration. Baicells Cloud OMC steps On the Baicells OMC, navigate to the Advance\u2192SAS screen where you can see the list of CBRS devices and their SAS status. Click on the 3 dots ( \u2807) symbol before the serial number for a particular device and click on \u201cProcedure\u201d to enter the SAS procedure screen. On the Procedure screen, you can see the most recent SAS logs, relinquish and re-request active spectrum authorizations, or de-register and re-register devices. First click on the \u201cAuthorized\u201d icon and click on the \u201cRelinquishment req\u201d button to relinquish the current spectrum authorization. Then the latter two icons will become greyed out, but the device will remain registered. We will need to fully de-register and re-register the device with the new parameters. Click the \u201cRegistered\u201d icon and then the \u201cDe-register\u201d button when it appears to de-register the device. Once the device is in the \u201cUnregistered\u201d state, click the \u201cUnregistered\u201d icon and then click the \u201cRegister req\u201d button when it appears. If all goes well, the device should re-register, and also request and receive a new grant (completing the full procedure) within a few moments.","title":"Step 2. eNodeB and SAS Setup"},{"location":"infrastructure/sas-setup/#step-2-enodeb-and-sas-setup","text":"","title":"Step 2: eNodeB and SAS Setup"},{"location":"infrastructure/sas-setup/#introduction","text":"Despite CBRS being a relatively open frequency band, the processes for spectrum access are still somewhat opaque and require significant capital investment and/or ISP-level resources to set up.

The FCC ID is used to identify this approved device type. The serial number specifies the exact device identity. Both can usually be found on the outside of the device (circled in image below). Beamforming Gain, Beamwidth Based on antenna specs in II.B EIRP Effective Isotropic Radiated Power of your system including both the base station radio and antenna. For a Cat B CBSD, this must be 46 dBm/10 MHz=36 dBm/MHz or lower. Calculate this value by adding the max transmit power (actually power density per MHz) of the base station, in our case 28 dBm, to the antenna beamforming gain, in our case 18 dBi; 28+18=36 dBm/MHz. For the units requested by the Google interface, add 10 to this value to specify power per 10 MHz instead of per MHz.

What is crimping an ethernet cable? Crimping an ethernet cable is the process of attaching connectors onto the ends of ethernet cables. This process is also called 'RJ45 crimping' because RJ45 is the name of the connectors that are used for ethernet cables, and they are what is being crimped. Why? Setting up networks involves setting up long ethernet cable connections between different devices. Instead of buying premade ethernet cables of varying lengths (e.g. 5ft, 10ft, 50ft, etc.), it's more practical to just have a big spool of cabling that we can roll out and cut to the exact length we need. Therefore we need to be able to attach RJ45 connectors to the ends of these cut cables so that we can actually plug them in! Crimping Kit Here are some tools you should have in your crimping kit! RJ45 Crimping Tool An RJ45 crimping tool is the most essential tool. Although it's technically possible to crimp ethernet cables without this specialized tool, it's not very practical for crimping lots of cables. Its primary utility is to do the actual 'crimping' part of compressing/crimping the tiny gold pins in the RJ45 connector onto the ethernet cables. It also has blades that can be used to cut or strip wires. Cable Stripper Cable strippers are used to take off the protecting shielding around cables and expose the inner wires. You can also do the same thing with a simple blade or pair of scissors. The trickiest part about stripping cables is trying to avoid cutting the inner wires! RJ45 Connectors RJ45 connectors are required for crimping because they feature the 8 golden pins that get crimped onto the 8 wires of the ethernet cable. They are what get plugged into ethernet ports! They also feature a latch/clip that locks the ethernet cable into the port once it is plugged in. RJ45 Boots RJ45 boots can be optionally used to protect the RJ45 connector. It provides insulation and prevents the cable from being breaking easily. They have to put slipped onto the cable before you put on the RJ45 connectors though! RJ45 Cable Tester RJ45 cable testers allow you to guarantee that you did the job correctly! They have two pieces that separate from each other, and you plug each end of your crimped ethernet cable into the port on each piece. Then you turn it on and the cable tester will test the connection for all 8 pins. If there are any missing lights on any of the pins, it means that you messed up somewhere and have to restart! How to Crimp an Ethernet Cable Assuming you have a crimping kit and an ethernet cable that needs to be crimped, here are all the steps! Step 0) Slip on the RJ45 boot (optional) Step 1) Strip the cable Push the cable into the razor slot of the strip tool and turn it around the cable to make an even cut around the sheath. Careful not to nick the wires inside! Unwrap the blue foil shielding and plastic to uncover the twisted wire pairs. Push the copper grounding wire to the side. (Ignore the white string.) Step 2) Organize the wires In this step, you'll be taking the 8 colored wires inside the ethernet cable and putting them into the correct ordering of colors. NOTE This is the hardest part of crimping! The wires are small and are hard to control. Take your time and make sure you do this step correctly! Otherwise you might have to go back and restart. Step 2.1) Untwist the wires There should be 4 pairs of wires: green, brown, orange, and blue. Each pair has a solid-colored wire and a striped-colored wire. Untwist these pairs and separate them into the 8 wires. Step 2.2) Straighten out wires After untwisting the wires, they are probably still kinked and look like they want to be twisted. In this step, you should carefully grab all the wires and try to straighten them out by pulling on them. This will prevent the wires from moving around later on. WARNING Don't break off the wires! Step 2.3) Lay out wires in order With your straightened out wires, put them into the correct order! Make sure that the wires are all flat and in line with each other. The ordering for these wires is: 1. Striped orange 2. Solid orange 3. Striped green 4. Solid blue 5. Striped blue 6. Solid green 7. Striped brown 8. Solid brown TIP After laying them out in order, straighten them out again as a group! This will help keep the wires together. Step 2.4) Trim the wires Trim the wires evenly to about 1/2 inch in length using scissors or the blade of your crimping tool. You want to make sure you have enough room for the wires to reach the end of the RJ45 connector. But also try to have room for the shielding of the cable to be inserted into the connector too. TIP You can put the wires side-by-side to the RJ45 connector to see how long you should cut it. Look at the next step to see what the final product looks like. TIP If you don't have the shielding inside of the connector, it makes it easier for the wires to snap off later, which is bad. TIP Make sure that you cut the wires evenly! Step 3) Slide wires into RJ45 connector Carefully slide your 8 wires into the connector. Make sure that the clip is facing away from you! If it is really hard to slide it into the connector, you probably didn't straighten out the wires enough in step 2.2 or 2.3. MORE INFO Inserting the wires with the clip facing away from you is the standard. However, you could technically do it in 'reverse' and insert the wires with the clip facing you, as long as you do it on both ends of the cable.

Step 4) Crimp it Push the RJ45 connector into the slot of your crimping tool for RJ45 connectors. The slot should be labeled something like \"8P\" for the 8-pin RJ45 connector that you're using.

Wireless communication is primarily powered by radio waves, a physical thing that we as humans cannot see or touch. In this article you will gain a layman's understanding of how wireless communication works. Specifically, this article will cover the following broad topics: Radio waves and the physics behind it Antennas How data is communicated via radio waves Examples of wireless communication technologies This is not meant to be a comprehensive article, so there will be a lot of simplifications, analogies, and informal explanations. Please let me know at domta@cs.uw.edu if you see any inaccuracies, misconceptions, or misnomers. Radio waves Radio waves are just oscillations of energy that exist throughout our environment. They can be generated naturally by lightning, or artifically by equipment made by humans such as cell phones. The technical definition of radio waves are that they are a form of 'electromagnetic radiation'. Other types of electromagnetic radiation include visible light (what we get from the sun), infrared, and X-rays. How radio waves are created To understand why radio waves are considered a type of electromagnetic radiation, it is helpful to know how we generate radio waves. This section is not important to fully understand, but it is good to skim to have a basic idea of how this stuff works. We create radio waves by moving electrons back and forth within an electrically conductive object (an object made of material that allows electrons to move freely, such as metals). This works because electrons have special properties: All electrons have ' electric fields ' surrounding them that attracts and repels other charged particles. All moving electrons produce ' magnetic fields ' that are the basis for how magnets work. Therefore, when electrons move there are two fields (electric & magnetic) present that combine to create creates an ' electromagnetic field '. By moving an electron back and forth in an oscillating (repetitive) motion, these electromagnetic fields are constantly being disturbed/moved in a way that creates electromagnetic waves or equivalently, electromagnetic radiation . In this GIF below, we see the charge of an antenna changing, representing electrons moving back and forth within the antenna. This creates pulsating electromagnetic waves. Note: in this particular GIF, it is actually only showing the pulsating electric fields. In this GIF below, we are able to fully see an electromagnetic wave with a 3D representation. The red component of the wave represents the electric field, while the blue component represents the magnetic field. Notice how they are perpendicular to each other! This is also why the GIF above didn't show both fields: it was a 2D representation! In this section, we learned about radio waves. In essence, you can just think of radio waves as physical phenomenon that look like these sine waves: With the proper hardware and knowledge, we can create any type of wave we want! We can vary frequencies (how fast the waves go by), amplitudes (how tall/powerful the waves are), and phases (what position within the loop the wave is in). Frequency & Wavelength It turns out that a fundamental characteristic of any given radio wave is its frequency. Therefore, it's important to know what 'frequency' means, and how it relates to the concept of 'wavelength'. Frequency is a measurement of how often something happens. In the case of radio waves, it measures how many cycles of a radio wave occurs in a certain amonut of time. Frequency is measured in the units of hertz (Hz) , which represents cycles per second. If we had a radio wave that passed through 10 complete cycles in a minute, it would have a frequency of 0.16Hz (10 cycles per 60 seconds). Wavelength measures the physical length of a single cycle in a radio wave. If we could see radio waves and measure it, and we saw that there was a distance of 10-feet between two of the peaks in a radio wave, then that radio wave would have a wavelength of 10 feet. In the image above, we can see a natural relationship between frequency and wavelength: a faster frequency means that you will have shorter wavelengths! Or conversely, longer wavelengths means that there is a slower frequency! When one value goes up, the other value has to go down; this is called an inverse relationship . So if I told you that I had a radio wave with a very high frequency, you could figure out that my radio wave has very small wavelengths. And actually, if I told you exactly what frequency my radio waves travelled at, you'd be able to figure out the exact size of the wavelength! For example, if I told you I had a radio wave with a frequency of 10Hz, you would be able to figure out that my radio wave has a wavelength of approximately 30,000,000 meters. This is because radio waves are a physical thing, so they always travel through air at the same speed: the speed of light. This means we can consistently convert back and forth between frequency and wavelength with some basic algebra. The basic equation, where c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s), is: frequency (Hz) * wavelength (m) = c So given a radio wave with a frequency of 10Hz, to solve for wavelength, I just need to take the speed of light and divide by 10! 30,000,000 divided by 10 gives a value of a wavelength of 30,000,000 meters. To summarize this section, frequency and wavelength are important properties of radio waves. Although they describe different aspects of a radio wave, they are essentially synonymous because we can easily convert between the two. When people are talking about radio waves, you may hear them talk in terms of frequencies (e.g. megahertz, gigahertz) or you may hear them talk in terms of wavelengths (e.g. meters). In the next section, we'll see why exactly frequency is such an important characteristic of radio waves. How we distinguish between radio waves An important thing to remember about radio waves is that nowadays they surround us everywhere we go! Radio waves are powerful because they can go through obstacles like walls, and they can potentially propagate over huge distances at a relatively cheap cost. Radio waves are used to communicate information in technologies such as GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, cell phones, music radio stations, and more. The problem with this is that these radio waves interfere with each other and combine together to become a jumbled mess! They are all co-existing within the same space, and they can't avoid each other. In real life we don't get to have nice, simple, isolated radio wave like in the previous sections, we get a mix of radio waves coming all at once! And somehow, we have to find and narrow down the signal we care about. Imagine you are at an airport and you're trying to talk to your friend, but it is super crowded and theres people talking and shouting all around you. It would be super hard to hear your friend and have a conversation! (In this situation the people represent devices that use radio waves, the sound waves represent radio waves, and the voices & words represent the data we want to transmit) But if your friend talks loud enough, even though your ear is full of noise from everyone else in the airport, you can still figure out what your friend is trying to tell you. This is because you're smart enough to recognize what your friend's voice sounds like and you can focus on that voice. We can do the same thing with radio waves of different frequencies! (Being able to focus on your friend's specific voice is analogous to being able to focus on only radio waves of a specific frequency) In the image below, we can see a red radio wave. This radio wave is actually the combination of 5 radio waves of different frequencies! In the blue, we see this same signal analyzed and split into the individual components, located at its respective frequencies. (Analogy: 5 people talking at the same time, what your ears hear is the red. Your brain recognizing that these are 5 different voices is the blue) The mathematical process of going from the red representation (the signal in the time domain) to the blue representation (the signal in the frequency domain) is called the \"Discrete Fourier Transform\". You may also hear about something called the \"Fast Fourier Transform\" which is the discrete fourier transform, but a very clever and fast way to calculate it. (Intuitively, the DFT/FFT is essentially comparing a bunch of sine waves of varying frequencies to the signal detected, and calculating how similar they are. This would be like your brain iterating through all possible human voices and checking to see how strongly your ears hear that particular voice) This means that even though there may be a jumbled mess of radio waves surrounding us at all times, if they are radio waves of different frequencies, we are able to distinguish between all these different frequencies using some old fashioned engineering. This non-trivial fact is what allows our world to have so many different types of devices communicating wirelessly all at the same time! They are all using radio waves, all in the same space, but at different frequencies! This is why radio waves are identified by their frequency (or wavelength). Summary In this section on radio waves, we learned about what they are, the basics of how they're produced, frequency & wavelength, and how we distinguish between different radio waves co-existing in the same space. These are the fundamental concepts behind the physics of radio waves that engineers take advantage of. In the next section on antennas, we will learn what they are and how they are used to efficiently propagate/send radio waves. In another section, we will learn more about how exactly we manipulate radio waves to convey the information we want to send. Antennas We use antennas in our everyday lives, but most people don't know how they work. We use antennas on cars, on buildings, and even within our computers and phones! How they work Material properties Antennas are all made up of electrically conductive material. This usually means antennas are made out of metals like copper. Materials that are electrically conductive allow electrons to freely move throughout it. The opposite type of material would be electrically insulating material. As a real-life analogy, imagine a typical swimming pool filled with water. A normal pool like this allows people to freely swim through it! In this analogy the water represents electrically conductive material and people represent electrons. Now imagine a piece of copper metal as being that pool of water. Because copper is electrically conductive, electrons can freely move through it! An analogy for an electrically insulating material would be a swimming pool filled with jello/pudding/gelatin. If someone tried diving into that pool, they wouldn't get very far and it'd be super hard or impossible to swim through it. In this analogy the jello/pudding/gelatin represents electrically insulating material and people represent electrons. Now imagine a piece of plastic being that pool of water. Because plastic is electrically insulating, eletrons are mostly stuck where they are inside the plastic! Taking advantage of moving electrons Antennas need to be electrically conductive because they transmit and receive radio waves by taking advantage of the movement of electrons. In the above section on \"How radio waves are created\" we learned that radio waves are generated by moving an electron back and forth in an oscillating (repetitive) motion. This oscillation of electrons occurs in the antennas. If antennas weren't electrically conductive, these electrons wouldn't be able to move and create these radio waves! How transmitting with an antenna works In order to transmit with an antenna, the antenna needs to be connected to an electrical component that can control the movement of these electrons. TODO: expand/clarify? How receiving with an antenna works Antennas receive radio signals passively. As the electromagnetic fields are manipulated in the environment around an antenna, the electrons in the antenna move accordingly (because of how the physics of it work). By monitoring the movement of these electrons, the respective radio wave can be captured. TODO: expand/clarify? Communicating with radio waves How do we as humans harness this power of manipulating radio waves as communication? We agree on a bunch of different rules and conventions on how we will manipulating these radio waves to convey information efficiently and responsibly. In the United States, most of these rules are established and enforced by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). An analogy To lay a conceptual foundation for this relatively abstract section, here is an analogy. Suppose we have two friends with the simple names of \"A\" and \"B\" that want to talk to each other over a distance, but they cant see, hear, or touch each other over that distance. The only way method of communication they have is a really long piece of rope between them. So once they travel far away from each other, they will each be holding one end of the rope and will be trying to communicate. But before they travel far away from each other, they need to talk to each other to figure out a set of rules of communication so that they can understand each other when they feel the rope moving. When coming up with these rules for communication, one of the first things that A & B need to do is come up with a language. Because A & B really like computers, they chose the language of computers: binary. They chose this language because it is super simple and effective; it only has two letters (1 and 0) and you can send tons of information by being clever with 1s and 0s (thats what computers do). Now the next thing that A & B needs to do is figure out how to use the rope to send these 1s and 0s. Here are some ideas they brainstormed together: * If the rope is moving up and down (oscillating), then that is considered a 1. If the rope is not moving, then that is considered a 0. * If the rope is oscillating super fast then that's a 1, but if the rope is oscillating slowly then that's a 0. * If the rope is oscillating super fast then that's a 0, but if the rope is oscillating slowly then that's a 1. * If the rope is oscillating with a big height then that's a 1, but if the rope is oscillating with small height then that's a 0. A & B realized two properties of the movement of the rope that they could capture: (1) frequency, how fast the rope is oscillating, and (2) amplitude, how tall the rope is when its oscillating. The term for manipulating these properties is \"modulation\". This makes sense because a dictionary definition of modulation is \"to adjust\"; modulation is just a fancy word for changing. In this analogy, the material/medium of communication was the rope. But in our context, the material/medium of communication is radio waves. Both of these materials have frequency and amplitude that can be modulated to send information, and demodulated to receive that information. In the next section, we'll learn about frequency and amplitude modulation. We'll also learn about some other types of modulation that don't have a direct real-life connection to ropes. Modulation Frequency modulation Amplitude modulation Other modulation schemes Frequency allocation Baseband signal and carrier signals Bandwidth Bands and Channels Wireless Communication Protocols In the previous section on \"Communicating with Radio Waves\", we learned how we are able to transmit messages wirelessly over radio waves via modulation. We understood this through our analogy with friends A & B who came up with a way to send letters in their binary language (1 and 0) through a rope. Assuming they were able to do this successfully, they could send long streams of messages that look something like \"101011100101010101010\". But that's still not enough! They need to come up with a 'protocol' for deciphering what this message actually means! For example, they could come up with a simple protocol for sending messages about how their day went. * The first 3 letters would represent how their day went: \"101\" could mean that they had a good day, and \"010\" could mean that they had a bad day, and maybe \"110\" means that their day went okay. * The next 3 letters would represent the weather: \"100\" could mean that it was sunny and \"101\" could mean that it was rainy. We have these same types of protocols in real life that are much more complicated. They are carefully designed to ensure security (can people intercept messages?), reliability (what if the message gets messed up in certain places?), and efficiency (how much useful data can we send at a time?).

Wavelength measures the physical length of a single cycle in a radio wave. If we could see radio waves and measure it, and we saw that there was a distance of 10-feet between two of the peaks in a radio wave, then that radio wave would have a wavelength of 10 feet. In the image above, we can see a natural relationship between frequency and wavelength: a faster frequency means that you will have shorter wavelengths! Or conversely, longer wavelengths means that there is a slower frequency! When one value goes up, the other value has to go down; this is called an inverse relationship . So if I told you that I had a radio wave with a very high frequency, you could figure out that my radio wave has very small wavelengths. And actually, if I told you exactly what frequency my radio waves travelled at, you'd be able to figure out the exact size of the wavelength! For example, if I told you I had a radio wave with a frequency of 10Hz, you would be able to figure out that my radio wave has a wavelength of approximately 30,000,000 meters. This is because radio waves are a physical thing, so they always travel through air at the same speed: the speed of light. This means we can consistently convert back and forth between frequency and wavelength with some basic algebra. The basic equation, where c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s), is: frequency (Hz) * wavelength (m) = c So given a radio wave with a frequency of 10Hz, to solve for wavelength, I just need to take the speed of light and divide by 10! 30,000,000 divided by 10 gives a value of a wavelength of 30,000,000 meters. To summarize this section, frequency and wavelength are important properties of radio waves. Although they describe different aspects of a radio wave, they are essentially synonymous because we can easily convert between the two. When people are talking about radio waves, you may hear them talk in terms of frequencies (e.g. megahertz, gigahertz) or you may hear them talk in terms of wavelengths (e.g. meters). In the next section, we'll see why exactly frequency is such an important characteristic of radio waves.","title":"Frequency &amp; Wavelength"},{"location":"learn/wireless-communication/#how-we-distinguish-between-radio-waves","text":"An important thing to remember about radio waves is that nowadays they surround us everywhere we go! Radio waves are powerful because they can go through obstacles like walls, and they can potentially propagate over huge distances at a relatively cheap cost. Radio waves are used to communicate information in technologies such as GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, cell phones, music radio stations, and more. The problem with this is that these radio waves interfere with each other and combine together to become a jumbled mess! They are all co-existing within the same space, and they can't avoid each other. In real life we don't get to have nice, simple, isolated radio wave like in the previous sections, we get a mix of radio waves coming all at once! And somehow, we have to find and narrow down the signal we care about. Imagine you are at an airport and you're trying to talk to your friend, but it is super crowded and theres people talking and shouting all around you. It would be super hard to hear your friend and have a conversation! (In this situation the people represent devices that use radio waves, the sound waves represent radio waves, and the voices & words represent the data we want to transmit) But if your friend talks loud enough, even though your ear is full of noise from everyone else in the airport, you can still figure out what your friend is trying to tell you. This is because you're smart enough to recognize what your friend's voice sounds like and you can focus on that voice. We can do the same thing with radio waves of different frequencies! (Being able to focus on your friend's specific voice is analogous to being able to focus on only radio waves of a specific frequency) In the image below, we can see a red radio wave. This radio wave is actually the combination of 5 radio waves of different frequencies! In the blue, we see this same signal analyzed and split into the individual components, located at its respective frequencies. (Analogy: 5 people talking at the same time, what your ears hear is the red. Your brain recognizing that these are 5 different voices is the blue) The mathematical process of going from the red representation (the signal in the time domain) to the blue representation (the signal in the frequency domain) is called the \"Discrete Fourier Transform\". You may also hear about something called the \"Fast Fourier Transform\" which is the discrete fourier transform, but a very clever and fast way to calculate it. (Intuitively, the DFT/FFT is essentially comparing a bunch of sine waves of varying frequencies to the signal detected, and calculating how similar they are. This would be like your brain iterating through all possible human voices and checking to see how strongly your ears hear that particular voice) This means that even though there may be a jumbled mess of radio waves surrounding us at all times, if they are radio waves of different frequencies, we are able to distinguish between all these different frequencies using some old fashioned engineering. This non-trivial fact is what allows our world to have so many different types of devices communicating wirelessly all at the same time! They are all using radio waves, all in the same space, but at different frequencies! This is why radio waves are identified by their frequency (or wavelength).","title":"How we distinguish between radio waves"},{"location":"learn/wireless-communication/#summary","text":"In this section on radio waves, we learned about what they are, the basics of how they're produced, frequency & wavelength, and how we distinguish between different radio waves co-existing in the same space.

A normal pool like this allows people to freely swim through it! In this analogy the water represents electrically conductive material and people represent electrons. Now imagine a piece of copper metal as being that pool of water. Because copper is electrically conductive, electrons can freely move through it! An analogy for an electrically insulating material would be a swimming pool filled with jello/pudding/gelatin. If someone tried diving into that pool, they wouldn't get very far and it'd be super hard or impossible to swim through it.

Suppose we have two friends with the simple names of \"A\" and \"B\" that want to talk to each other over a distance, but they cant see, hear, or touch each other over that distance. The only way method of communication they have is a really long piece of rope between them. So once they travel far away from each other, they will each be holding one end of the rope and will be trying to communicate. But before they travel far away from each other, they need to talk to each other to figure out a set of rules of communication so that they can understand each other when they feel the rope moving. When coming up with these rules for communication, one of the first things that A & B need to do is come up with a language. Because A & B really like computers, they chose the language of computers: binary. They chose this language because it is super simple and effective; it only has two letters (1 and 0) and you can send tons of information by being clever with 1s and 0s (thats what computers do). Now the next thing that A & B needs to do is figure out how to use the rope to send these 1s and 0s. Here are some ideas they brainstormed together: * If the rope is moving up and down (oscillating), then that is considered a 1. If the rope is not moving, then that is considered a 0. * If the rope is oscillating super fast then that's a 1, but if the rope is oscillating slowly then that's a 0. * If the rope is oscillating super fast then that's a 0, but if the rope is oscillating slowly then that's a 1. * If the rope is oscillating with a big height then that's a 1, but if the rope is oscillating with small height then that's a 0. A & B realized two properties of the movement of the rope that they could capture: (1) frequency, how fast the rope is oscillating, and (2) amplitude, how tall the rope is when its oscillating. The term for manipulating these properties is \"modulation\". This makes sense because a dictionary definition of modulation is \"to adjust\"; modulation is just a fancy word for changing. In this analogy, the material/medium of communication was the rope. But in our context, the material/medium of communication is radio waves. Both of these materials have frequency and amplitude that can be modulated to send information, and demodulated to receive that information. In the next section, we'll learn about frequency and amplitude modulation. We'll also learn about some other types of modulation that don't have a direct real-life connection to ropes.","title":"An analogy"},{"location":"learn/wireless-communication/#modulation","text":"","title":"Modulation"},{"location":"learn/wireless-communication/#frequency-modulation","text":"","title":"Frequency modulation"},{"location":"learn/wireless-communication/#amplitude-modulation","text":"","title":"Amplitude modulation"},{"location":"learn/wireless-communication/#other-modulation-schemes","text":"","title":"Other modulation schemes"},{"location":"learn/wireless-communication/#frequency-allocation","text":"","title":"Frequency allocation"},{"location":"learn/wireless-communication/#baseband-signal-and-carrier-signals","text":"","title":"Baseband signal and carrier signals"},{"location":"learn/wireless-communication/#bandwidth","text":"","title":"Bandwidth"},{"location":"learn/wireless-communication/#bands-and-channels","text":"","title":"Bands and Channels"},{"location":"learn/wireless-communication/#wireless-communication-protocols","text":"In the previous section on \"Communicating with Radio Waves\", we learned how we are able to transmit messages wirelessly over radio waves via modulation. We understood this through our analogy with friends A & B who came up with a way to send letters in their binary language (1 and 0) through a rope. Assuming they were able to do this successfully, they could send long streams of messages that look something like \"101011100101010101010\". But that's still not enough! They need to come up with a 'protocol' for deciphering what this message actually means! For example, they could come up with a simple protocol for sending messages about how their day went. * The first 3 letters would represent how their day went: \"101\" could mean that they had a good day, and \"010\" could mean that they had a bad day, and maybe \"110\" means that their day went okay. * The next 3 letters would represent the weather: \"100\" could mean that it was sunny and \"101\" could mean that it was rainy. We have these same types of protocols in real life that are much more complicated. They are carefully designed to ensure security (can people intercept messages?), reliability (what if the message gets messed up in certain places?), and efficiency (how much useful data can we send at a time?).","title":"Wireless Communication Protocols"},{"location":"learn/wireless-communication/#wifi","text":"","title":"WiFi"},{"location":"learn/wireless-communication/#bluetooth","text":"","title":"Bluetooth"},{"location":"learn/wireless-communication/#cellular-communication","text":"","title":"Cellular communication"}]}
