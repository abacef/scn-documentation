# Why Have a Community Network?

Internet access is a foundational component of many aspects of modern life, nearly as important as electricity and water service. Though internet service is generally available in many areas of the United States, there are still areas that are underserved because of a variety of geographic and socio-economic factors, or simply because traditional internet service providers do not find it profitable to install and maintain the necessary infrastructure to serve some areas with adequate internet.

Community networks attempt to address this digital divide by connecting underserved communities. Because a community network is created, managed, and maintained by volunteers, it is able to serve areas that may not have other affordable internet options.
