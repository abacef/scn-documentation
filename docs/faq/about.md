# About Seattle Community Network

Seattle Community Network (SCN) is a community network dedicated to providing fair access to underserved communities all across the Puget Sound. SCN is a project of Local Connectivity Lab, a 501(c)(3) registered non-profit that works to share free or low-cost broadband access in higher-need areas throughout the Puget Sound region, making use of existing network infrastructure such as buildings and fiber-optic cables to extend coverage to more people.

As a community network, we rely on the help of local residents such as yourself to maintain and grow the network. [Joining us](../../community/join) is a great way to become an active member of your own community, make friends, and learn valuable technical skills.
