# How can I Help?

## Volunteer!

SCN is run completely by volunteers. There are many ways you can help, and no technology skills are required. We need help with everything from setting up network hardware and developing software to community outreach and fundraising. If you want to help, we can use your talents!

First, make sure you [get connected with our community](../community/join.md).

Next, why not [Join a Team](../community/teams.md) or [Contribute to SCN Docs](../contribute/contribute.md)?
