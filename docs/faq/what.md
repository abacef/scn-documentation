# What is a Community Network?
"Community Networks (CNs) are crowd-sourced collaborative networks, developed in a bottom-up fashion by groups of individuals – i.e. communities – that design, develop and manage the network infrastructure as a common resource. Importantly, at the centre of CNs and the socio-economic ecosystems they generate lay the communities and their members, who are essential to initiate, maintain and guarantee the success of these connectivity efforts."
